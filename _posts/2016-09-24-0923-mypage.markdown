**Free hosting with GitHub Pages**  
GitHub Pages are powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), so you can easily deploy your site using GitHub for free—custom domain name and all.

Getting Stated
-----
* Of course, head over to [Github](https://github.com/) and get your account if you do not have one.
* Create a new repository named username.github.io, where username is your username on GitHub; i.e. *maxjtsai*.github.io. ( note: *the first part of the repository has to be exactly match the username; otherwise, it won’t work!* )
* Clone your Github repository via command-line (via terminal) or [desktop tools](https://desktop.github.com/).
* Authoring content with your preferred [IDE](#authoring)
* More details at [Pages at Github](https://pages.github.com/)



Authoring
-----
* It is Markdown: [kramdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/). Here is the [Quick Reference](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html).
* [Brackets](http://brackets.io/) is a modern, **Open Source** text editor that understands web design and it has a [Markdown Preview](https://github.com/gruehle/MarkdownPreview) plug-in.
