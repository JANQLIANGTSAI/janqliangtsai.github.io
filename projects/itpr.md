#### About
**IT Purchase Review (ITPR)**

The Information Technology Purchase Review (ITPR) form and process was created to help purchase requesters make well-informed purchasing decisions for IT products and services, address the Universityâ€™s obligations to comply with existing laws, policies, and standards, and make best use of campus IT resources.

The ITPR form must be completed prior to the purchase or acquisition of any IT-related product or solution, regardless of funding source or total cost. The ITPR form was designed to be dynamic, and the number and types of questions displayed changes based upon specific responses about the purchase, the product/solution and its intended use.

Based upon responses provided in the ITPR form, a more in-depth assessment may be required to address:

* Accessibility
* Information Security and Privacy
* Technology Integration and Support
* Procurement and Contracting
